## Implementation Notes

### Scraper Considerations
- Many sites use calendar widgets or JavaScript-heavy interfaces
- Some sources (like Sedgwick County Zoo) use state-dependent UI without unique URLs per category
- Facebook groups require authentication
- Eventbrite and Meetup may require API access for reliable scraping
- Adult hockey schedules use query parameters for filtering - may need specialized handling

### Priority Tiers (Suggested)
1. **High Priority:** City government, major venues (INTRUST, Century II, Orpheum), established cultural institutions
2. **Medium Priority:** Educational institutions, omnibus aggregators with good structure
3. **Lower Priority:** Specialty interest sites, venues with limited event volume

### Data Quality Expectations
- Government sources: Highly structured, reliable
- Major venues: Generally well-formatted with consistent patterns
- Aggregators: Variable quality, may contain duplicates across sources
- Social media: Requires authentication, data quality varies

### Duplicate Detection Strategy
Event deduplication will be critical given overlapping coverage. Consider matching on:
- Event title (normalized)
- Date/time
- Location/venue
- Source organization
