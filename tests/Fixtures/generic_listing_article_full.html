    <p>The city council convened for a lengthy meeting on Tuesday evening, covering zoning changes, transit funding, and a new code enforcement pilot. Residents filled the chamber to offer comments on proposed bike lanes and on how the city would pay for the improvements.</p>
    <p>Council members debated whether to delay a vote until additional studies are published. Planning staff shared that grant deadlines are approaching, pushing leaders to move quickly. One member said the project could reshape downtown, while another worried about rising costs and the ability to maintain the network over time.</p>
    <p>After more than three hours of discussion, the council agreed to advance the proposal to a final vote next month and asked staff to prepare additional outreach. Several officials emphasized that community input would continue, promising neighborhood meetings and more detailed cost estimates before construction begins.</p>
